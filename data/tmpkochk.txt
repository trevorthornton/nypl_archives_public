Kenneth Koch Papers, 1939-1995 Finding Aid

Scope and Content Note The Kenneth Koch Papers (ca.1939-1995) consist of holograph manuscripts and typescripts of the author’s published and unpublished work (in every genre, including plays, “comics,” and games), notes and other material related to the works, Koch’s correspondence, photographs, collaborations, material related to his work with children, miscellaneous personal documents, printed material, ephemera, scrapbooks, press cuttings and photocopied reviews of his books, and holograph manuscripts and typescripts of works by other writers (especially Frank O’Hara and John Ashbery). Holograph and typescript drafts comprise the bulk of the collection; the published material is arranged chronologically, the unpublished alphabetically by title. The correspondence is mostly made up of incoming material, of which there are three categories: personal, professional, and fan mail. The personal and professional correspondence is arranged alphabetically by author; within each author’s folder letters are arranged by date. Of the personal correspondence and works by others, the most substantial material is by “New York School” artists such as Frank O’Hara, John Ashbery, James Schuyler, Larry Rivers, Harry Mathews, Fairfield Porter, and Jane Freilicher. Also noteworthy are letters and works by Koch’s former students, Ron Padgett, Frank Lima, Tony Towle, David Shapiro, and Jordan Davis. There are also publishing contracts and royalty statements for several of Koch’s books. Purchased from Kenneth Koch through Glenn Horowitz, 1995-1997. Collection Processed by Michael Schwartz and Rodney Phillips.
