archives_data_public
====================

This is most of the original code from NYPL's archives data management application - shared for sharing's sake.

This is not a functional app - all of the stuff that would make it a real Rails app has been removed. This is just the original code that we wrote, and not quite all of it, because some of it was specific to NYPL and would not help you.

You can borrow any of this code and incorporate it into a new Rails project if you're so inclined, but neither the developer nor NYPL make any guarantees that any of it will work for you (not that it won't, we're just not making any promises). It's just here so you can see what we're doing and how we're doing it, which may or may not be appropriate for your situation.

Thanks, and good luck to all of us.
